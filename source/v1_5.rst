.. _version1.5:

=========================================
Draft format of the v1.5 extended SK data
=========================================

This format breaks backward compatibility with all previous versions of the
format. To distingush from earlier formats Slater-Koster files distributed from
the `dftb.org <http://www.dftb.org>`__ site will use th the file extension
`.sk2`. The format is extensible (within some limits) and consists of a series
of labelled blocks of data.

Generic format of a data block
==============================

Each section starts with a block label, begining with ``@`` as the first
character at the start of the line, followed by the block name. The format of
the block data will depend on the nature of the data tag.
