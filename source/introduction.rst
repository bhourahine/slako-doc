This document attempts to set out the format for several versions of the
Slater-Koster data used in the `DFTB <http://www.dftb.org>`_ method.

All current format versions are ordinary ASCII text files, with common file
extensions of .skf (:ref:`version0.9` and :ref:`version1.0`) or .sk2
(:ref:`version2.0`).
